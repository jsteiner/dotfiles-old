# dotfiles

## Install

Install and use [iTerm2].

Set `zsh` as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Change to your home directory and clone this repo, then change to the new
dotfiles directory:

    cd && git clone https://github.com/jsteiner/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles

Download submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

Run `brew update`.

Tap thoughtbot formulae:

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae

Install all packages:

    brew install git vim zsh the_silver_searcher fasd tmux reattach-to-user-namespace rbenv ruby-build rbenv-gem-rehash rcm gh

Install:

    env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The
`-x` options, which exclude the `README.md` file, are
needed during installation but can be skipped after the first time.

Rename `/etc/zshenv` to `/etc/zprofile`.

    sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zprofile

By default, OS X's zsh config resets `PATH` for every zsh instance, which can
cause problems with Vim. More info [here].

Set up vundle:

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    vim +PluginInstall +qa

Remap `Caps Lock` to `Control`. Thank me later.

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Tab -> Modifier Keys

Configure iTerm:

* Install the [light] and [dark] Solarized for iTerm2 themes.
  * Set them in Profiles > Colors > Load Presets
* Under Profiles > Terminal
  * Set `Scrollback Lines` to 0 *if* you are using tmux.
  * Set `Report Terminal Type` to xterm-256color
* Under Profiles > Text
  * Disable `Draw bold text in bright colors`

Configure git. Create a `~/.gitconfig.local` file and replace the following with
your information:

    [user]
        name = 'Josh Steiner'
        email = 'josh@jsteiner.me'
    [github]
        user = jsteiner


If you like what you see in osx-settings, run `./osx-settings`.

## Updating

Pull down changes:

    git pull origin master

Use [rcm] to symlink new dotfiles:

    rcup

## Make your own customizations

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = dan@thoughtbot.com

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # recommended by brew doctor
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Bundle 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Bundle 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'
